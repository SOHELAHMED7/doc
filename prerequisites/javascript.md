# Javascript

You will interact with the authenticators through an HTML page and Javascript using the Webauthn API.

We highly recommend the use of [@simplewebauthn/browser](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/packages/browser/). This library provides lots of easy and useful features and it fully compliant with the specification.

Note that is mandatory to use the HTTPS scheme to use Webauthn otherwise it will not work.
